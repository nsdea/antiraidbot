# AntiRaidBot
AntiRaid Bot: An open source Discord Bot to prevent user spamming and join "raids".

# Quickstart
- [**Invite and add** me to your server](https://bit.ly/3fcleIi)
- Type **`ar!setup`** in any channel.
- You're done! 
- You may follow the instructions displayed, if any

# Troubleshooting
If the bot doesn't appear, after you've invited it to the correct server, make sure this bot has the permission to view the current channel.
Check if you invited the bot correctly by going to **Server Settings** -> **Intergrations**, if the bot appears, you just have to give it a role with management permissions (banning, kicking) and of course viewing channels. If it doesn't, invite it (see "Quickstart").
